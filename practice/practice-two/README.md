## Target

- Apply useContext for state management .

- Take a narrow view to check re-rendering and optimize performance of one React application.

- Become better understood and create your own custom hook to reduce redundant code.

- Study and apply uncontrolled components in some cases to avoid needless state management gradually.

- Be aware of catching common and specific errors (errors from api, from logic,...) for one React application to prevent crashing issues dramatically.

- Check PageSpeed scores frequently during development time and ensure the scores at minimum 98 points.

- Keep moving with Storybook which will assist to manage components in the development environment.

- Apply React Query, React Hook Form, Zustand.
